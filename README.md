# My First Website
My testing ground for implementing and consolidating new ways of developing that I'm learning. For now this project includes javascript, node.js (and bunch of modules), express, work with MySQL database

Currently implemented client-server interaction by API with express and AJAX\fetch, registration page for account creating, cookie usage to recognize the account by server, server-database interaction to retrieve and write data (the client sends to server only the unique ID stored in the cookie), profile page (with user's avatar), general chat or rather bulletin board where each user can post a message on his behalf (login), express routers, some kind of simple "friends" functionality from social networks and others

Of course this site will change and improve in the near future :)
